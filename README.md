A Minecraft 1.7.10 mod for making Biomes O' Plenty work better with other mods.
These interactions have been fixed in newer versions of Biomes O' Plenty, but not for 1.7.10.

## **Changes**
* Thaumcraft
    * Allow Silverwood trees to spawn all BOP biomes that are forests or plains.

## **Requirements**
* [Biomes O' Plenty for 1.7.10](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/biomes-o-plenty)
* [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.7.10.html) (whatever version BOP requires)

All other mods are optional. For example, this mod won't crash if you don't include Thaumcraft.

A Minecraft 1.7.10 mod for making Biomes O' Plenty work better with other mods, as well as adding some personal tweaks.
These interactions may been fixed in newer versions of Biomes O' Plenty, but not for 1.7.10.

Every change can be enabled or disabled in the config file.

## **Changes**
* General Tweaks
    * Removed Gravestones from spawning in the Nether. They are useless.
    * Made Biome Essence Ore spawn in the End.
    * Made Celestial Crystals spawn in the End.
    * Removed Enderporter recipe. Can be reenabled in the config.
    * Made the Biome Finder recipe harder by making it require Celestial Crystals and Ghastly Souls.
    * Added a recipe to craft Rotten Flesh out of Chunks of Flesh and Eyebulbs.

* Thaumcraft
    * Allow Silverwood trees to spawn all BOP biomes that are forests or plains.
    * Add Aspects to some BOP items that were missing them.
* Industrialcraft 2
    * Fixed the spawning behaviour of Rubber Trees. No more hundreds of floating Rubber Trees in marsh biomes.

## **Requirements**
* [Biomes O' Plenty for 1.7.10](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/biomes-o-plenty)
* [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.7.10.html) (whatever version BOP requires)

All other mods are optional. For example, this mod won't crash if you don't include Thaumcraft.
